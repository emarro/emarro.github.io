# About Me
I'm currently a grad student in CS at Cornell working somewhere between machine learning and genetics. During my undergrad at UT Austin I double majored in computer science and biochemistry and I've bounced around a number of projects involving differential gene expression, rna sequencing, and using machine learning in biological settings such as speeding up genotype imputation, applied deep learning, and more. 


## Things I work in/with
Throughout my my work I’ve worked in a variety of programming langues, functional and imperative, including OCaML, Lisp, Julia, Go, and Python (although Python is by far what I’ve spent the most time in). In addition, throughout my coursework and research I’ve dabbled a bit in applied math, a lot of machine learning (pytorch), statistics, bioinformatics(in R and python), cloud computing (Azure, a bit of AWS), population genetics, and software engineering (large amount of genetic information sometimes require bespoke solutions to run in a reasonable amount of time).

## Early Life
I’m a hispanic man, spoke spanish as my first language (although my English is considerably better now), and I grew up in south Texas. I never would’ve imagined I would working in Computer Science and adjacent fields. My highschool didn’t even have a CS course! I picked up all this stuff starting in my second year of undergrad, and just went down multiple meandering paths to learn and build cool things through course work and different projects. 

## About this website


 This website serves as both a place for me to jot down ideas I've found cool, write ups about key points from previous projects as a journal of sorts, and to chronicle some of my experiences. It's public in the hope that if someone finds it, they might find it useful or at least partially entertaining. To practice my communication skills, I attempt to write so that a non-expert can still follow along to the majority of posts (an undergrad student in a different field for example) as I believe that communicating what you do and learn is as important is as important as what you actually do.
