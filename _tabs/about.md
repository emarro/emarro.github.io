Hi, this page is full of the inane ramblings of me, a grad student in CS who does work between machine learning, genetics, and
computational biology. I use this site to update notes about methods or papers I find cool, and to archive some of my thoughts about previous projects. I keep it public in case anyone else finds this interesting or is looking for another perspective about the stuff
that I place here.
