I'm currently a grad student in CS working somewhere between machine learning and genetics. During my undergrad I double majored in computer science and biochemistry and I've bounced around a number of projects involving differential gene expression, rna sequencing, and using machine learning in biological settings such as speeding up genotype imputation. This website serves as both a place for me to jot down ideas I've found cool, write ups about key points from previous projects, and as templates for me to fill in as I learn more stuff. It's public in the hope that if someone finds it, they might find it useful or at least partially entertaining. One self imposed restriction here is that I intentionally try to keep explanations at a high enough level that a non-expert (an undergrad student in a different field for example) might still be able to follow along, as a challenge to myself.
