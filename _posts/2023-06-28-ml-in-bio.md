# A New Age of Genetics
Whenever I do one of my "Computational Biology for Computer Scienctists" crash courses, the same few topic usually get the bulk of the reactions and subsequent discussion. 
1. The sheer size of the human genome (~3 Billion Base Pairs)
   1. And subsequently, how humans share $\approx 99.9\%$ of the genome, and so most of the genetic variation in humans comes from that $\approx 0.1\%$.
2. The fact that even defining the genome is deceptivly difficult .
   1. What exactly is a gene? 
   2. How do we deal with variants? 
   3. What about regulatory elements that don't actually change the expressed gene (usually). 
3. That even after all this time, there are large swaths of DNA that we don't have a clue about what it really does.

We know significantly more now than we used to about the general structure of DNA though, such as 
1. which regions have higher or lower mutation rates (it varies by location and by the base pairs present at that location!) 
2. patterns of co-occurence/linkage disequillibrium, 
3. better understanding of the regulatory environemnt of the human genome.
